# This file contains the list of PCIe adapters that are valid to associate with a
# BG/Q Node.  The list is checked, at boot time, by rc.sysinit and compared to
# the PCIe adapters associated with the ION.  If an attached adapter is not found in
# this list, a RAS event is thrown.  Note that we are checking for both the IBM and
# Mellanox part numbers in each adapter's VPD.

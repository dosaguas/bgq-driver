BUG:
	localhost and 127.0.0.1 don't work as binary hosts
	start reply needs failure info.
	
Needed:

The start thread in the agent may need to be joined when the bin is killed
* While the retry count parameter is stored in the Alias, the actual count of retries
  should be stored in the binary controller.  --Never mind-- That can't work b/c new
  binary controllers are built for each binary instance.

Policy work:
       * Note that a policy with a 'killed' trigger will only fail over
         if the binary is actually sent a kill sig OR a failover
	 request comes.  Make sure that a failed bin with that policy
	 will actually f/o with a f/o request even if is dead for a while.
	 
NOTE: All functions executing in threads need to catch normal exceptions
and either handle or re-throw as boost::thread_interrupted if program termination is not the desired behavior!!

Locking needs auditing.  See threads file  

create API test cases

WIBNIs:
binary_status might need to be able to deal with an alias

Make agent wait timeout in startservers configurable.

Binary controller may need to be split up between master's rep and agents active
object.

How about a ring buffer of error messages and a command to recover it?
